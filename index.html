    <p class="page-description">Currently, I am headed back to school to get my certificate in Computer
    Technology to supplement my BA degree. I am looking for a part time job related to my field of current study to gain some more experience in programming,
    information security, and web and software development. I have spent the past year and half working as a Financial Systems Specialist
    at CBRE and before that, I was a technician at the NDSU IT Help Desk. When I finish my certificate in spring of 2017,
    I would like to work as a programmer, computer systems analyst, or a web/software developer.</p>
